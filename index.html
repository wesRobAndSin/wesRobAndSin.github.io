        I am an aspiring web developer based out of New York City,
        currently enrolled in a prestigious bootcamp known as App
        Academy.  It is an immersive, 1000-hour full stack web
        development course with an acceptance rate of less than 3%.
        My projected graduation is January 2017, but for now feel
        free to check out some of the projects I have completed below!
